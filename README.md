A digital forensics report done as pair work. We were given a physical hard drive which we had to inspect and create a report for. The subject was suspected to have illegal material (anything bird related) on the hard drive.

The investigation comprised of making a forensic copy of a physical hard disk drive and using several different methods to find hidden, deleted and visible files that could hold evidence of any crime.
